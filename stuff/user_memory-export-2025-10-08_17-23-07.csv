LinguaVault is designed to help preserve and document endangered languages. I notice you're currently on the Add Content page, and you've already begun contributing to the community - that's wonderful!

Here's a quick overview of what you can do here:
1. 📝 Add words & translations (you've added ""ee"" and ""dope"" so far)
2. 🎯 Organize with categories (I see you haven't created any yet - this would be a great next step!)
3. 📸 Upload rich content like audio, videos, or cultural information
4. 👥 Share with the community (you've already shared one item - great start!)

Would you like me to guide you through setting up your first category to organize your words? Or would you prefer to explore another feature? I'm here to help with whatever interests you most!

Some recommended next steps:
- Create categories to organize your words
- Add audio recordings to your existing words
- Practice with your saved words
- Upload cultural content
